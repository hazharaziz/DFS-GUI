# DFS-GUI
This project is the graphical user interface of the graph and also its main goal is to visualize the depth first search algorithm.
We have used the python programming language and mainly the pygame module for implementing the GUI. The program has four buttons that
consist of 'Add Node', 'Add Edge', 'DFS' and 'Reset'. 
We will welcome your ideas and contributes.
